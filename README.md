## General Info

Creating a Weather dashboard utilizing JQuery, Javascript, CSS, HTML, and the Open Weather API connection (https://openweathermap.org/api). 

This exersize helped introduce the concept of API connections.  
1. There was an initial API call to look up the weather for a specific city. This required input from a user to enter a specific city. 
2. The second API call was to get the UV index
3. The third API call was to get the 5 day forecast

There were several challenging aspects to the project. Integrating and linking the API calls, understanding the type of data and reviewing the documentation, and correctly creating items and displaying correctly on the HTML file. 

Utilized for loops, if statements, and function calls in order to get all areas to work. It was a great first introduction to working with API's. The last part was the favority buttons and making it work correctly.

##### Future_scope
Future scope would be to add several times throughout the day, so that the user can plan out their day. Wouldlalso like to improve the mobile layout to look better.
